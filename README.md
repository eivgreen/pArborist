# pArborist
A Seed for Privacy - semi-automatic privacy-revealing data detection in databases and data streams

## Run pArborist

### For Experiements:

Execute expr.py. 

Due to the size limit of github, only the cache of a portion of the datasets are utilized. 

They follow the same distribution and schema of the original dataset, see [1], [2], [3], [4].

### For Users of pArborist:
Replace the contents in expr_seeds with your own seeds. One row each.
The format of a seed is:
  number event1 event2 event 3...


Put the seeds into expr_seeds.txt, one column each and
